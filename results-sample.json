      "If you could work anywhere, what would you do?- Wouldn't you want to work towards genuinely making the world a better place?- Wouldn't you want to work in a close-knit team alongside some of the brightest engineers in the industry?- Wouldn't you want to work on solving interesting problems that haven't been solved before?---At Khan Academy, I truly believe that you can find all of those things and more. We're a small, 50-person nonprofit tech startup making a big difference in the world. A few weeks ago, we found this great story through the fascinating blog \"Humans of New York\" – please take a moment to read it:http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64412654576/i-struck-up-...This is just one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives that we've transformed, and there are thousands more we don't hear about.Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of math practice exercises. Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.This gives us the ability to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. As I write this we're running dozens of A/B tests to learn what we can do to make people learn more, from testing how review scheduling affects accuracy to simply testing different teaching styles.Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business – though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.---I'm going to put in a special plug for mobile: Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two people (me and one other person) working on our apps right now. Our iOS app is fairly basic, but it already has a few million downloads. We want to make it awesome. If you're a mobile developer we can build a great team around, please reach out. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.We're hiring engineers (web, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. Oh, and if you want to have a great summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.Apply at https://www.khanacademy.org/careers directly (say you saw us on HN!) or feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org with any questions.[1]: http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...[2]: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...",
      "> \"You need: Authorization to work in the US\"Understandable given your size yet personally quite disappointing :( Any plans for sponsoring visas in the near future?",
      "Right now I believe we can sponsor renewals but not initial applications. I don't know of any immediate plans to change that, sorry.",
      "KA probably receives too many applications. Even when, some time ago, I was happy to volunteer for free, I just got an automated email and no response. Perhaps because of visa issues ? Or maybe there is too much supply because who would not want to help change the world ?",
      "If you never received a (human) response from us, that's a mistake on our part. I'm sorry about that.Unfortunately coordinating volunteers takes a lot of time and we haven't found it in our interests so far to really go down that road; in order to be able to move fast we're currently looking to hire only people with a longer-term commitment.",

      "SpaceX - Los Angeles, CA http://www.spacex.com/careersWe seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!\nNote for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",

      "DaisyBill - 34 W 15th Street, NYC - http://www.daisybill.comSenior Ruby/Rails/JS developer, full-time and local onlyDaisyBill does workers' compensation e-billing for the state of California.We're a small company with 5 people in NYC and 2 in California.Workers' Comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that performs services on the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.--We're looking for someone to help us with a new product/revenue stream we're going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We're also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.I'm Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.I'm looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2/PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I'd like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is also a plus. We use Git and I'd expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don't test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.I do interviews similarly to the way they're done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you're looking for in a position I'd have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they're interested in. I don't do conference room whiteboard programming.I don't have a degree, and I don't expect you to have one, either. I don't necessarily care about how long you've been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you're capable and can show it, I'm interested.You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.Cheers.",

As a result, we're looking to expand our engineering team. We are looking for full-stack engineers, back-end data engineers, and front-end data visualization interaction designers.If you're focused on the backend, you should have experience with high write performance DBs (e.g. Redis, Cassandra), large-scale log analysis (e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Hive), and big distributed cloud systems (e.g. >20 node cloud deployments). That will mean you'll hit the ground running here.For the front-end, you should know modern web and mobile design principles and be particularly excited by d3.js and its associated ecosystem.You'd be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we feel like an elite task force, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.You should be an expert in a mainstream programming language, preferably Python or JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.Also, if you happen to be an experienced software engineer who wants to end up in a role with a mixture of product management, customer interaction, and individual contributions to the code, we have just the position for you. Let us know -- we're looking for you.If you join us, you'll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media. Our software aggregates data on over 5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.Apply by sending a (short!) cover letter to work@parsely.com. Mention this HN post and say you're looking for Andrew.Include links to online portfolio, Github, LinkedIn, or any similar services, if you have them.

That's a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there's a lot to it. It says that we think they're smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they're passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They're largely modeled after Google interviews (there's a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we've had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the \"getting the right answer\" not being the interesting part of the interview).Specifically - We're looking for:Backend Developers:\nYou're a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we're building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we're looking for people who care about performance. A lot.Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you're willing to learn. If you don't know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they're probably the only folks around who might get the intricacies of what you're excited about)We're looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you're a Senior Engineer - you've worked in server-side code for a few years. You've scaled to thousands or millions of users. You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.If you're a Junior engineer, you love to code and you're good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited. (New grads please apply!)Android and IOS engineers:You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience. You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.",

      "Spantree - http://www.spantree.net/jobs - Chicago, ILWe're Spantree, a small, nimble boutique consultancy based mostly in Chicago. We're looking for another smart person to join our team in the West Loop of Chicago. This candidate should enjoy learning new things and solving hard problems.We work almost exclusively with open source software and we're not shy about jumping into third-party code to figure things out.  You should be motivated to submit pull requests and hunt down project committers on Twitter and IRC when you're stuck.Some of our favorite day-to-day technologies include Groovy, Grails, Elasticsearch, Drools, MongoDB, Backbone.js/Marionette, CoffeeScript and Puppet.Our clients range from small and scrappy startups to large hospital networks and software as a service providers. Historically, most of the stuff we've worked on has not been public-facing: it's either guarded behind the client's firewall, neatly tucked away as a library or jammed into the minds of the developers we've mentored. But we're starting to diversify from \"behind-the-scenes\" work to more early-stage product development.Fundamentally, we like to work on tools that helping people make better decisions. This can take the form of a search engine to help people find interesting stuff to do on a Saturday night, a complex workflow management system for evaluating health insurance claims or a matchmaking and scheduling system to help people book face-to-face meetings at conferences.We're looking for generalists who can quickly go from problem to working solution and communicate effectively with our peers and clients along the way. While we have a very strong technical stack already, you don't expect new hires to be an expert in everything right away.  In general, though, we're looking for people with the following qualifications:* One or more fun languages: Ruby, Python, Groovy, Clojure, PHP, CoffeeScript, etc.* One or more boring languages: Java, C++, C#, etc.* One or more web frameworks: Grails, Rails, Django, SpringMVC, Play, CakePHP, etc.* One or more databases: SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, we like it all.* HTML, CSS, JavaScript and at least one framework* Git, or a colorful excuse for not knowing it.* The typical software development toolchain: text editors, IDEs, step debuggers, issue trackers, etc.If you'd like to learn more, please email jobs@spantree.net to  set up a Google Hangout.",

      "Layer (https://layer.com) San Francisco, CAThe Internet needs an open communications layer -- cross-platform and free from an advertising-supported business model. At Layer, we’re on a mission to deliver it. We’re hiring iOS, Android, backend, Web and systems engineers, as well as designers.We have problems to solve that you’ll have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Here’s why:We’re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  We’ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.We’re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.We’re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.We’re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.We care about documentation: https://layer.com/docs/ios.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.We care about design.  We won’t be releasing our own apps - that’s up to our customers - but we’ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don’t have the keys we can’t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)Today we're a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We’re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.We’re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. We’ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com",
      "Apptimize / San Francisco Bay area / H1B welcome / iOS, Android, Frontend, Backend engineersApptimize dramatically tightens the innovation cycle for native Android and iOS apps and aims to become a framework vital to every app. Developers love Apptimize because feature flagging and phased rollouts give control and flexibility. Our framework also cuts down on programmer requirements by letting people edit and control app elements and features without programming or redeploying. Our goal is to accelerate app innovation by making it shockingly easy to improve apps.Our team has experience building complex systems, and can do it in one third the time most would consider possible. We are well-funded, selective, and believe smaller teams are better. You will be an essential part of our team.Specific positions/requirements:iOS and Android library developers: \nExtreme attention to detail is critical because you’re working on code deployed to billions of app installs.

For Android, be ready to explore the Android source code.Backend/frontend developers: \nA full stack developer, you can work on a feature from requirements and design to programming and testing.

We need help supporting that load.Keen IO is a fully managed cloud API that lets developers build complex, hyper-custom, large-scale analytics and data science features directly into their web, mobile, or Internet of Things applications.Our currency is event data, and events are a pretty broad abstraction. Every time someone draws a breath, clicks a link, loads a website, pauses a song, or starts a car, there's an event. Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable :)It's probably worth mentioning that we're a platform company, not a product company. This means our customers are using the platform to build for an emergent and rapidly growing set of use cases. The same flexibility that makes us future-proof for a given customer also makes us future-proof from a market perspective. So while a product company seeks a certain kind of product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us: our customers build it for themselves.Things we look for in a new team member:  • Learning agility \n  • Abstract reasoning \n  • Empathy\n  • Potential is more important than credential \n  • Confidence, but tempered by humility & the drive to get even better\n\nSome things we believe in:  • Mission = The Discovery of Truth.\n  • Radical transparency \n  • Design with a capital \"D\" \n  • Introspection \n  • Distributed innovation \n  • The importance of laughter \n  • Relationships are everything \n  • Play to your strengths; patch your weaknesses with diverse collaborators\n\nApply:  https://angel.co/keen-io/jobs",

We're a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.",

In the past two months, I've worked with Objective-C,\n    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.\n  \n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n  \n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, \n    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with\n    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n  \n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. \n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n  \n  - Affordable housing. If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the \n    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought \n    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my \n    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n  \n  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of\n    startups. The energy here around the growth in technology and the support\n    for entrepreneurs is infectious.\n\nA little bit about you:  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n  \n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n  \n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n\nIf you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why you’re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com",

      "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\nIt's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nFamiliarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:\n* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)\nThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/ (The Future of Peer Review) and here http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/ (The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers.

      "Off topic.Having had a melanoma myself, this area obviously interest me.Have you thought about a grander vision i.e. using a high def camera taking picture of he entire body in one snap and then analyzing that data?I have more than a thousand moles, many of them abnormal, so using a camera on a per spot basis is simply not safe enough with the current technology.",
      "We're aware our core change-detection engine has many uses, particularly in the medical space. We're focussed on making a home-tracking service for moles to start out with that works with smartphone to begin with, although we plan to branch out into other areas as the company grows. We're not like the many apps out there that will tell you whether or not you have cancer for $2.99, we're working with dermatologists, GPs and image processing experts to make a service that is robust and safe.We have a grant from the UK's Technology Strategy Board - a Government initiative - to research video-based capture instead of our current photo-based approach. This would alleviate many of the problems you've highlighted with regards to the convenience of capturing the data. Video capture would be the main focus of the person we hire.We're also keen to point out we're not a diagnosis service, nobody but a trained medical professional can tell you whether or not you have a melanoma. All we're doing is helping you spot change as soon as possible.",
      "Thank you for your thorough answer.And yeah not even the dermatologist can yet tell you whether you have a melanoma or not, for that an actual sample is required.Perfect solution for early detection in my mind would be some sort of drug or cream that would highlight which moles are melanomas and then somehow allow of a system to see that highligh (ex. change for color)But just wanted to say I am glad there are someone out there working on it.",

      "We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn't invent the concept of a \"pop up shop\", we're embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our  time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.We're looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform. Someone who's comfortable working with the whole stack, understands the principles of excellent software development, and wants to treat their code as their craft. We're primarily in a Django/Python environment, but any relevant experience is great, as long as you are willing to learn Python. The number of years you've been working professionally isn't too important (though it should be at least \"a few\"), but what you've done is. Being an expert in SQL will get you a lot of points. We follow Agile development practices, and you'll be shipping features frequently.--Skills and Attributes We're Looking For (being 100% in all is not required, but candidates who are will receive preference)* Experience building web applications from the bottom, up. Django/Python experience preferred, but Rails/Ruby, PHP, etc. is also great, so long as you're a quick and willing learner* Solid knowledge of SQL and related best practices. We use Postgres, but are happy with MySQL or similar experience* Ability to work in Javascript/HTML/CSS. We use YUI 3 and Bootstrap. You certainly don't need to be a designer, but you should be able to take on a feature and fully implement it, including all relevant front-end code* General understanding of Solr/Lucene search* Experience deploying basic server infrastructure and with the Unix command line (being an expert SysAdmin is not required)* Familiarity with code profiling and optimization* Interested in things like Agile development, TDD, and pair-programming* Work equally well in close coordination with others and independently/self-directed. We're a small team, so we'll always be working closely, sometimes in pairs, but often you'll need to be able to take on things on your own* Legally eligible to work in the UK (mandatory)What We're Offering* Competitive salary, based on experience* Meaningful, early-employee equity* Regularly attend some of the coolest pop-up events and parties in London* Work on a developer-driven software team, where your contributions will have a hugely positive impact on the lives of othersMore About UsWe're a group of Brits and Americans who came together in the spring of 2012 to take on an ambitious idea cooked up by 2 of our co-founders in a pub one evening (where all good ideas start). We're artists and environmentalists, consultants and entrepreneurs, engineers and educators.

      "Yup, we're a recruitment company (amongst other things).  However, we're very specialized. We focus on international IT recruiting where companies are willing to sponsor you for a work permit (or the local equivalent). This is because my wife and I are both serial expats and we believe that people should be able to live anywhere in the world they want (we're not saying it's practical, but it's still our dream).Thus, since we have a lot of background in this area, I'm moderately well-known in the IT world and I keep getting companies contacting me to help them find people (because of my \"how to become an expat\" blog http://www.overseas-exile.com/), we decided that we'd create a company to help people live their dreams.We're proud of the fact that we help people move to other countries. We're particularly happy with one young developer who escaped a violence-filled, high unemployment country. Of course, since we're \"just recruiters\", we're stereotyped and there's no easy way to shake that, but I'm proud of the work we do.",

      "@Curtis (Ovid) Poe: I am not going to make an ad hominem retort directed at you as I am aware of your contribution to Perl and also that you are legally bound by Booking.com not to speak ill about them.All that I am saying is, there are a lot of ways of making money and it isn't correct to put your reputation at stake to advertise a tainted company such as Booking.com for a couple of thousand euros.The frequent advertisement for developers is not only due to the exodus of senior devs (including you) from the company but also because booking is trying to create a redundant pool of devs so that the business doesn't get effected by this employee churn.If an employee complains he/she is asked to leave the company and all that is because they have a huge cash reserve built out of years of underpaying developers and exploiting hotels.Years of copy paste has made the code unmaintainable and I am not talking about the new code Aevar and you had written for Booking::Search but Booking::Maxotel, Availability, Policy system, Search::Which, Search::When, etc.\nI have never seen a company which rebukes its developers for refactoring or treat its developers like dogs except at Booking.As they have a real bad reputation in the Perl community they are trying to get developers from other communities who are ignorant.Booking.com not only mistreats its developers they also bully the hotels using their monopoly.Successful lawsuits have been filed against the company for price fixing as can be googled.Only if a dev is unemployed should he consider working for Booking.com.

Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users. You've built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.\nOur FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same.

      "Interaction / Interface Designer – EyeQuant.com – Berlin, GermanyEyeQuant is a SaaS company that uses neuroscience and machine learning to optimize interfaces for higher conversion rates. We're spun out of Caltech, our customers include Google and Spotify and we're backed by some fantastic investors.We're now looking for our first full-time designer to join our team of 7 in Berlin. You'd be responsible for all interaction and visual design in our products.Here's what we think is important about the role:    • Code – You won't be expected to write production code, but you should know\n      your medium well: what's possible with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and what's easy \n      or hard. Most importantly, you know how to communicate effectively with your \n      developer peers.\n\n    • User research – You should care deeply about the people you're designing for, \n      and willing to get involved in research. If you're passionate about running \n      guerilla user research for the team yourself, that's great, but not a \n      requirement.  \n\n    • Interaction vs. visual design – All else being equal, we prefer someone who is \n      great at organising information and making complex flows feel simple over \n      someone whose core strength is crafting beautiful interfaces. We're a small \n      team though, so you will be doing a bit of both. \n\nAll that said, none of us come from a design background, so we'd love to hear from you if you disagree with any of the above and think you'd be a fit!You should come with an interest in quantitative evaluation of design efforts - both with our own products and A/B testing. If you think that's heresy, you won't be happy at EyeQuant. If you believe that design and science have a lot to learn from each other, you'll have a shot at shaping the very industry itself.Get in touch at: niko@eyequant.com",

Most of our positions are location-independent (remote), but a few are for the Los Altos area.Generic Hiring page: http://elasticsearch.com/about/jobs/------------------------------------------ About Elasticsearch ------------------------------------------We build an open source search and real-time analytics engine.

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research. 3.7m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.We are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( http://www.testng.org ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( http://mailinator.blogspot.com ). And we're only up to 7 people.  But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.Job Description:  \nSomeone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.Our technology includes: \nJava. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)Job Requirements: \nYou know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.The interview:We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.

      "San Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoftSr. Javascript UI EngineerWhy should you join MuleSoft?Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We're talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company's applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?\nAt MuleSoft, we're already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we're taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule \"bus\" to be the nexus of an entire enterprise's integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.\nAnd that's why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.Where do you come in?First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform. Since it's a new product, there's very little legacy; and since we're still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.Second, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you'll bring in some other new technology to the stack.Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world's biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.And you? You already know you can create killer UI's based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it's a given that you're a master of all things HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. But isn't it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?Click here if you're interested\nhttp://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=o9SBXfwj&s=ycombinator",

      "San Francisco, CA.  Java Engineer No remote.\n2-5 years experience Java, Amazon experience, OO architecture exposure sql/mysql,  some Hudson or Jenkins exposure, hopefully exposed to Puppet or Chef, great would be some build tools like Ant.\nContact Robert at rbocknek@birst.com",
      "A couple recommendations:- \"2-5 years experience Java\" - There are vastly different ways to use Java, so someone like me would be in the 2-5 years of equivalent experience for things like Android, Swing or JavaFX development.  JavaEE has progressed immensely and while the cool kids aren't using it, annotation-based development has led to the same sort of \"convention-over-configuration\" style programming and a lot of code generation from a fairly small amount of code.  You don't have to generate 10 classes and interfaces for each EntityBean (EJB1 and EJB2) anymore.- \"... tools like Ant\" - Managing dependencies in Java can be a real headache, so you want to specify a tool-chain that has dependency management.  Say something like \"Ant+Ivy\" or \"Maven\".  For integration with Hudson/Jenkins, Maven is superior but either will work.- \"OO Architecture\" needs to be melded with an MVC/MVP pattern for big projects.  These architectural patterns help immensely with testing and code management (plus watch for package tangle in Sonar).- What's the rest of your tool-chain?  You left a lot of holes and it's not clear from your ad which technologies you use and which you want to use.  For comparison, here is my toolchain (I could give you more detail but not here):  - JavaEE\n  - WildFly\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - CouchDB\n  - Maven\n  - Jenkins\n  - Sonar\n  - Nexus\n  - Vagrant\n  - Ansible\n  - JUnit and plugins (XmlUnit, DBUnit, etc)\n  - Selenium2 (on the grid server and managed by Jenkins)\n\n- \"Amazon experience\" is not very specific.  I think we'll all assume you mean AWS, but there are APIs for running shops and for using mechanical turk.Hope this helps!",

Every time I tell someone I'm working at Google in Madison, they're shocked that there's an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There's fun technical work in Madison, I promise.I'm working on a hardware/software co-design project that's attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms. I'm sorry I can't describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=45087&https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=2069001&Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you're downvoting this, I'd be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don't care about Madison? Because you don't like big companies? Because you're cynically trying to push your job post above this one? Because you think job postings need bullet points?",
      "Just had a recruiter from Google contact me. They do pretty often, once a year. I usually tell them I am not interested. This time the guy mentioned they have some interesting work. So I said ok, I'll talk to him. Set up a time. Waiting for the call. Get an email that he can't make it. Ok, reschedule. Set a new time. Get confirmation he would call. No call, no email not anything.I am thinking WTF. I wasn't even the one interested in the position, is this level of unprofessionalism common with Google?Sorry don't mean to derail the comments, but it just kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. And then seeing Google as first comment on HN hiring, kind of brought that back to my mind.",
      "Similar experience. Took 4-6 weeks to get a reply to my application email (I'd actually forgotten about it). 4-6 weeks after that (and a few emails from me chasing it up) Google were able to schedule a phone interview. Interviewer was really friendly, and I was pretty excited. Got an email shortly after saying \"great that went well, can we fly you to (nearest Google office)\". Replied sure - I'm free anytime. 4 weeks later (and a few emails from me chasing it up) and I find out the recruiter has gone on holiday. Another 4 or so weeks later (and more emails from me chasing it up) and I'm told they are having trouble finding someone to interview me for the in-person. Another 2 weeks later I'm finally told the position was filled, but as a promising candidate I should consider applying for other positions.The idea of working at Google is interesting, but I don't really have the months to invest in the interview process.",
      "A good strategy for getting hired at a big company is to find an internal advocate. It is easy for the Google HR/recruiter to ignore individual candidates, but it is harder for them to ignore you if they get an email from another Google employee asking about the status of your application.How do you find an internal advocate? Start networking. Find people at Google with common interests or backgrounds as you. Then send me a cold email introducing yourself. It will take a few months to develop a relationship where somebody will happily send that email to HR for you, so start a few months before you are planning to submit job applications.",
      "And at least you were the one who made the first contact. I wasn't even interested to start with, they came to me trying to impress me with new and interesting working going on in that group. I was kind of surprised. For some reason, (and I don't even know why) I expected more from them. Oh well, no need to waste time on them in the future.",
      "Also similar to mine. Someone called me first time but the phone call was bad and he scheduled a new meeting, but he didn't call me back in the scheduled day. 2 days later he sent me a mail trying to reschedule it. As I was travelling i gave him a new number to call. He called in the first one and sent me a message saying that i wasn't there. I think i sent something like 5 emails later to explain that he called in the wrong number, but he never response me back.",
      "UW-Madison produces a ton of computer engineering talent. Cray, Intel and Nvidia all recruit heavily here. Sadly outside the Google office there aren't many local options for grads so they end up in Texas or California, even when they often want to stay in Madison. I've always thought you guys were genius for having an office in town.",
      "By any chance can a technical/coding interview be done completely offline?And preferably with more relevant tasks, rather than asking to come up with Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm on the spot, whereas Knuth, Morris and Pratt spent months of researching.",
      "I didn't downvote you, but \"sorry, no remote work\" is a comical restriction for this field, especially for a large organization like Google.",
      "Is your hypothesis that all types of work in \"this field\" (which, exactly?) spanning all levels of interactivity can be performed equally well by remote workers? I have personal experience that such a hypothesis is demonstrably false, even for pure software projects. I can only imagine how much more so the disconnect would be when the work involves hardware.",

There is absolutely no reason to make them come to an office.",

      "If you're doing firmware/software people can just mail you devkits, proto boards.",
      "devkits and proto boards do have bugs, especially during the early iterations. There are many occasions that I (firmware engineer) need to sit down with FPGA/Hardware engineers to figure out why the system is not performing as designed, sometimes it is firmware issue, sometimes it is hardware, and it was the combination of firmware/hardware and ambient temperature!! It is way more ineffective to perform this kind of debugging with someone in a remote site.",
      "That could be quite time inefficient, depending on where you live...",
      "Wisconsin is home to some other interesting tech companies too.  If you're into HPC, Cray has a big presence there.  I think that a lot of job hunters make a mistake by only considering the \"startup\" scene like Silicon Valley, Boston, etc. when they really are looking for interesting tech jobs not necessarily startup work.",
      "Is the interview process for working in Madison any less than the ~4 month long nightmare in SV?",
      "Does Google-Madison stack-rank like the rest of Google?",
      "Why is Microsoft all over the blogosphere for stack ranking, but I know dozens of Google folk and this is the first I've heard of it at Google?",

      "Interesting that location affects salary. If you move to a location with lower living costs, is your salary cut?",
      "I would usually agree with you, but in this case the difference between high-low is not that big and they give fixed equity. They are upfront about it.I would still encourage this company to not take location into account for salaries. Why should the company take the benefit from your choice(or lack of) to live in a cheaper place? You live there, you took the risks and the tradeoffs, but the company is taking the benefit from it... Some companies pay 3-10 times lower salaries and even if they give you stock options you can't afford to buy the shares when the time comes. This is not the case here, but it may become an issue in the future.",
      "Glad you asked this, it's something we're constantly pondering. Right now the answer is yes, though we don't do it ruthlessly and our overall philosophy is to show that we truly care about everyone involved. We ask the team member if they feel it's appropriate, rather than forcing it. We've actually not lowered someone's salary in this way yet, though it seems sensible that it would happen.The fact is that the living costs (largest chunk being accommodation) varies so drastically, that it feels hard to justify having the same salary and basing salary purely on skill, with the assumption that location truly is a choice and people have chosen to live somewhere cheaper. We have people who end up paying $2,500/mo rent and others where it is more like $800/mo or even less.In addition, we always want to pay people more if they choose to move somewhere more expensive, it seems unfair if someone gets used to a salary in one place and suddenly they move somewhere much more expensive, and we don't help them out.I'd love any more thoughts you have on this :)",
      "> with the assumption that location truly is a choice and people have chosen to live somewhere cheaperThat's a terrible assumption to make. People often live where they do due to obligation to others (family usually). I would never work for a company that would consider cutting salary because they moved to a lower cost area. I also know several people that have quit a job rather than relocate to a lower cost part of the country with an employer as the relocation also included a cut in pay.",
      "To be clear, we are agreeing with each other. I think that is an incorrect assumption, too. We consider each case very carefully, and often don't cut the salary (it has happened more that we didn't cut salary).That said, it is very easy here in the comments to argue how bad it is to cut the salary when someone moves to a cheaper location. However, the flip-side of the same coin is what about when someone moves to a more expensive location? Should we then say \"this is the fixed salary and you choose where to live, and if you move somewhere more expensive that is your choice\"? I don't think that is fair. So the other side of the coin of \"salary goes down if you move somewhere less expensive\" is that we increase salary if you move somewhere more expensive. We've done this for people and it is highly appreciated.Our overall philosophy is that we want to help people to be wherever in the world they can be happiest and most productive. We encourage traveling and we have set ourselves up as a distributed team based around this value.",
      "> However, the flip-side of the same coin is what about when someone moves to a more expensive location? Should we then say \"this is the fixed salary and you choose where to live, and if you move somewhere more expensive that is your choice\"?I'd say that's absolutely fair, it's kind of the default expectation in my mind at least - I provide a certain value to the company as a remote worker, for which they pay me accordingly.

      "In the first place, you should set the salary as if the employee was from the expensive place. So no cuts or raise because of moving to other places.",
      "Nothing wrong. This is standard industry practice. Check out glassdoor salaries for companies in diverse locations.",
      "Face-less industry BigCo's is another thing.Startups are more personal, small teams, that once in a while all of them, including the \"boss\", gather together to drink a beer or soda, and you know that on that table, people with same responsibilities have same compensations. It feels fair.",
      "If anything, it would seem un-fair to pay a US-based programmer the same salary as to someone working from India. Just look at it from the US guy perspective.",
      "From US guy PoV: Gee, this guy does the same work as I do, but he's paid 5 times less... something is wrong with our company.There are reasons US guy won't want to live in India, right? So the salary should compensate at least some part of those reasons (I mentioned in another comment here).Most people with jobs from poor countries have to support way many family members or relatives than that US guy.",
      "The company in this case does not appear to be moving to where you live ;)",
      "Low-cost place usually means a poor country - more risks, bad education/schools (so you have to pay premium for private...), unemployed family members, unemployed parents and other relatives, etc...So think twice before penalizing people from poor countries.",
      "I'm not entirely sure about the \"usually\", it may or may not be true. But to offer a different view here, I'm from Sweden and cost of living in Sweden is extremely low. If you have an apartment or house outside the capital it costs next to nothing, we have no health insurance costs, no education costs, food is not particularly expensive compared to the rest of the industrialized world and so people usually feel it's OK to offer a lower salary in Sweden on that argument.",
      "Depends on city, try finding a cheap apartment in Stockholm, not to mention car and gas costs. Etc.\"Extremely\" low...",

We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!",

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research. 4.1m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nWe are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.

We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&D we're doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there's just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we're doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we're a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people's lives.

Some of these include: wearable sensors, consumer health devices, smartphones, and genetic testing services (like 23&Me). We collect this data, normalize it, and have built an API to allow any application developer to easily and securely build applications with our service.We are looking for a long term hire, and this position includes meaningful equity in an exciting, fast growing startup.The person joining must be an opinionated, independent thinker and feel comfortable making big decisions. You have experience shipping real products to users. You are broadly curious, have probably had some side projects, and you have ideally hacked around with some hardware as well.You are versatile across technologies and platforms, and can teach yourself what you don't know quickly. You don't identify with specific technologies as much as you identify with the problems that need to be solved.Ideally, though not required, you have some experience with distributed database systems (cassandra, hadoop, hbase, etc.), security (HIPAA), and generally get excited about data, sensors, health, and how we can combine them to make people healthy at scale.We are based in Palo Alto, California - the right candidate can work remotely for a time period, though we would like to get the whole team under the same roof soon.Come help us build the human health data infrastructure layer.To apply, send an email directly to andrei@humanapi.co with your background, some relevant links (github, linkedin, etc), and any questions you have :)",

But if you are hungry for challenges in the intersection of Big Data / Machine Learning. Talk to us. Contact me at dominiek at bottlenose dot com (Recruiters NOT OK).Bottlenose is headquartered in LA with a large part of the development team in Amsterdam. Technologies we use: Cassandra, Storm, Hadoop, MongoDB, Node.js.Our Vision:The Stream. It's what matters now. From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what's actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenose’s core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights. StreamSense gives organizations the emotional intelligence that they didn’t have before. It allows them to sense what people are feeling and to anticipate the unknown unknowns - both the good and the bad.Attempts at creating machine understanding of our world like the Semantic Web and the Knowledge Graph have failed due to two fundamental flaws: 1) A model of the world is not something that should be derived from documents written by experts; 2) In order to build a ‘global brain’ you need to understand human emotion and human intend.Bottlenose’s ultimate mission is to create a global artificial brain. This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world. We think this will give us a shot at creating an incredibly powerful Artificial General Intelligence.",

The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER\nAs a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\nThe flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!Note for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",

Verba helps colleges and universities transform themselves so that they a) embrace the power of transparency and the internet, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make approximately the same profit margin from course material sales.About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.We're looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

We want your help scaling our thousands of events per second and terabytes of data. If you're a fan of distributed systems and like to stress-test a new database every other week, you'll fit right in. And it won't hurt if you like streams, trying out ES6 features, and open-sourcing your work.Our entire backend runs on Node, with a sprinkling of Redis, Mongo, and RabbitMQ. We're open to running a variety of languages and could still use someone to show our Go and Erlang libraries some love.Think that might tickle your fancy? We've got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:Live Debugger\nYou'll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn't it always?). You'll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.MapReduce for All\nWe'd love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?Data Export APIs\nPerhaps you'd like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?). Exporting will have to stream terabytes of data without waking our ops guys in the middle of the night. Then, you'll deploy the system to EC2 and test it, and announce it to the world!To apply, email us at jobs+backend@segment.io with:  - a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github (if you have one)\n  - what languages and frameworks you like to use, and why\n  - any bash command you'd probably use to inspect a logfile\n\n\n-----Mobile EngineerWith our new iOS and Android SDKs we want to change the mobile analytics game. The market is flooded with new mobile analytics startups, but underneath they all collect the same data. And anytime you make an analytics change, you have to re-submit your app to the app store. Bummer. :'(Developers can drop in our SDK and then later enable any of Segment.io’s dozens of analytics integrations without writing additional code or even submitting updates to the app store. Both iOS and Android SDKs are open source, so you'll be working closely with the rest of the community (and get a great chance to show off your work).Here's some examples of what you'd probably tackle at Segment.io:Best New Tools\nAs the maintainer of the SDKs, you'd have total control over which analytics tools get added and distributed across millions of devices. What are the best new tools? Something for an interesting new app category? Help our users find the best-in-breed mobile analytics tools, and build them into the SDKs so that they can enable them instantly.Community Distribution\nAs Segment.io's mobile expert, you'll be guiding (and helping write!) lots of the mobile content marketing we produce. We want you to become the world's leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out. We'll help propel you to become a thought leader in a brand new field.Xbox, Playstation, Roku\nYou could also play around on new platforms, bringing analytics bliss to the home entertainment world and gaming platforms.To apply, email us at jobs+mobile@segment.io with:  - a description of an app you worked on (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github if you have one\n  - the most interesting mobile SDK you've worked with and why\n\n\n-----Customer EngineerAt Segment.io, customer support drives the focus of the entire team. We're looking for a hungry engineer (don't worry, we'll feed you) who approaches customer support with an analytical efficiency. You'll keep finding new ways to improve the product, libraries, and docs wherever it's needed. For most of our users, you'll be the face of the company. Are you suave, courteous, and patient? :)You'll be responsible for analyzing our richest source of data: support requests. \"Where is support coming from? Why do customers need help? Which parts of the product need the most love?\" You'll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here's the breakdown:35% are variations of \"thanks your product is super awesome!\" which are fun.\n25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup.\n15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android.\n10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node.\n5% are completely confused, but we still <3 them.\nand the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries.\nThis kind of analysis should feel natural to you!Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team. We want to make sure we're all building things that will benefit our customers.Segment.io's support team also educates our customers on how the product works.

You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items.

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 70 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.We're well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.==================================Mobile EngineerEarlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (https://ifttt.com/mobile). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor's Choice, #1 Productivity). We're looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).==================================Platform EngineerWe’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects.

No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

We strive to achieve this by delivering disruptive thinking to companies with ambitious missions, keeping technology at the heart of what we do. As a Principal Technical Consultant, you're responsible for creating and implementing cutting-edge technology solutions for our customers whilst driving software excellence to influence and shape the wider software industry as well as our business.As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:- You love coding. Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you've no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you'll have had exposure to recent technologies. \n- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.\n- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.\n- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here’s what you can do:- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the world’s largest airlines. Build out a new capability within ThoughtWorks - perhaps for Mobile, Big Data or DevOps. Explore ways to improve our business relevance for customers. Create and implement an original tech solution to manage high broadcasts for a new live sports coverage. Travel and work on high impact global P3 (pillar 3) projects in locations such as Africa or Ecuador. Deliver the new technology platform for a government agency providing tailored information to the public's needs. Speak at conferences. Influence and shape our client portfolio. Get published.There's no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a programme inception to build a new product. It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation.

Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

      "New York / London - Bloomberghttp://jobs.bloomberg.com/ http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be sponsoring / attending RobotsConf in December, too.",
      "I interviewed once at Bloomberg. Kind of rocked the phone interview on algorithms and then on-site everybody was acting like if they hated to be there to deal with me. Plus it was weird as it was a Rails position and I got interviewed by people not in the team I was applying for on college C++ internals stuff. So be careful guys :>The office looks really nice though. And the projects sound pretty sexy.",

Right now publication is slow, un-innovative, and expensive - we want it to be fast, innovative, and free. We're a platform where scientists upload and share their research directly, and track metrics on the impact of their work. These metrics help when they apply for jobs and grants.A leading climate scientist in Germany told us \"Academia.edu shows the impact of your work that is not covered by Web of Science and citation indexes of that sort. With Web of Science you only learn how many people have quoted what. But with Academia.edu I can see what is viewed, what is actually read or not. Here I learn something additional, something I would not know otherwise.”5.1 million academics have signed up to Academia.edu, and around 1 million join every 2 months.We are a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We are looking for full-stack engineers, designers and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, CoffeeScript, Backbone, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish.Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.\"There are some core values that define the Academia.edu culture. Since everyone in Academia.edu is involved in running the company, we look for these values in everyone we hire:* Being a do-er - \"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena\" - Theodore Roosevelt* Being driven - \"Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end.

We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don't, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We're at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.We're giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You're startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?What do we have to offer?\n* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that's full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.\n* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).\n* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).\n* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).\n* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.\n* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.\n* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you'll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you'll make here versus what you're making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you're after - then this is not for you.

      "NYC and Washington, DC.\nFull-time and internship.The Go Circuit (http://gocircuit.org) is hiring Systems Engineers.Original job posting: http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineerPROJECTThe Go Circuit is a development, distribution and execution environment for a new generation of self-sustained distributed applications. The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company's infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.RESPONSIBILITIESFull-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.QUALIFICATIONSThe ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:* Full-time candidates should have B.A./B.Sc., M.A./M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.* Four or more years of experience with a low-level/systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don't need to be a specialist.)* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.* Ability to read academic publications in Computer ScienceMost importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.COMPENSATIONCompensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.\nLocationTo apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.",

      "Square — NYC https://squareup.com/ ---Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

We use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. By joining us today, you get a unique chance to engineer new technology from the ground up. Working in tandem with the company’s CTO, you will tackle both back end infrastructure and a web front end.

Our roadmap includes two key tasks that the Director of Engineering must be equipped to lead:\n* Take the back end to the next level by splitting it into multiple databases that each fulfill a specific purpose, and shard our primary data warehouse so it can handle tens of terabytes. The choice of technologies is still to be determined, so a broad range of experience with distributed systems and nosql databases is desirable;\n* Build an interactive web front end that dynamically displays geospatial data, in the form of both maps and charts. We are looking for a track record delivering interactive web applications, experience with web maps, and good programming skills both server-side and client-side.Individuals who are creative, honest, open-minded, enterprising, kind and attentionate to details will fit our team the best.

And we love enabling others to have that feeling. So we’re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and experts can get their insight much faster.Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but existing software requires an unnecessarily large amount of statistical knowledge to ask simple questions. And even experts find these tools time-consuming and painful to use. So most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that’s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term \"Data Science\", built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).We're hiring.

Since being founded in 2009 by recent Cambridge and UCL graduates who noticed a gap in the market when making their own leavers' yearbook, we have had considerable success: over the past two years our sales have grown more than tenfold and we are now the market leader in the UK. After a particularly successful academic year in 2012-2013, we’re expanding our development team and are now looking for an ambitious Junior / Graduate Developer to help us to continue to grow.Your job will involve working on many different aspects of our software and technology systems. We’ve managed to automate a highly complex design process, allowing us to create customised book layouts at the push of a button. This has involved bringing together many of the latest and most exciting software technologies and combining them in new ways to build a genuinely innovative piece of engineering. While we won’t expect you to understand it all straight away, you’ll be given the freedom to work on whichever parts of the system most interest you, and will be supported by the rest of the development team in learning the best practices of modern software engineering. This will include opportunities to get involved with: front-end development using the latest OOP JavaScript frameworks, back-end development, DevOps and automated server provisioning using Chef and Vagrant, automated testing, continuous integration and automated layout design.Working at Yearbook Machine is not the corporate grind: we’re a small group of like-minded, focused individuals working to create a product we genuinely believe in. We work hard but our environment is relaxed and friendly. Our office is based in a light and airy converted warehouse in central Shoreditch, which we share with another design startup. We're currently a team of just 6 people, 5 of whom are developers.Requirements  - 2:1 above in Computer Science or other similarly technical degree subject\n  - Experience with OOP and at least some knowledge of modern software development paradigms such as MVC\n  - A genuine passion for technology: we’ll be interested to see what you’ve been doing in your spare time!\n\nBenefits  - Highly competitive, above-market salary\n  - Generous stock options\n  - The best equipment: Your choice of computer and monitor(s) and a comfortable chair\n  - Job satisfaction: we make a product that is fun to build and that our customers love!\n\nTo apply, please email your CV and cover letter to jobs@yearbookmachine.com with the subject “Graduate / Junior PHP Developer”",
      "AppDynamics -- San Francisco, CA -- H1B welcomeAppDynamics is a successful, well-funded startup in Application Performance Management space. Our product and business model are proving to be quite disruptive in a very large market. Companies like Netflix, Priceline.com, Deutsche Bank, Williams Sonoma, Betfair and Expedia are using AppDynamics to ensure the performance and availability of their revenue-critical applications.AppDynamics' traditional products for JVM, CLR, PHP and Node.js kick ass at measuring server-side performance across your app. But with the shift to highly interactive websites and mobile apps, an increasing number of performance problems are caused by client-side code or internet latency. End-User Monitoring measures the performance that your real users' experience by instrumenting client-side platform APIs. EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions/billions of users?* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:Browser Agent:* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.Mobile Agents:* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.Cloud:* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It's a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map/reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi \nversion, etc.* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.UI:* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand. If you have skills or interest pertaining to any of the above-mentioned areas, please write to me at bthomas@appdynamics.com",

Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines.

      "Boulder COSimple EnergyDjagno Engineers, DevOps Engineers.Simple Energy uses social game mechanics to change how people save energy and how utilities engage customers. They make saving energy “social, fun and simple.”By engaging people on the platforms they already use, including email, Facebook, web, and mobile applications, and making energy usage data into a simple scoring system that allows people to compete with their friends and neighbors online, Simple Energy motivates people to become interested in their own energy use and take action to reduce consumption. The system is based on leading behavioral economics and game mechanics research by scientific advisor Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality. Results from a recent pilot program show that the platform can produce an average energy savings of 20% with up to 50% in savings for top performers.See our open positions at http://utilities.simpleenergy.com/about-us/jobs",

Bridging the gap between real estate professionals and their clients. Real estate is the largest industry in the world. It’s also one of the most important—after all, everyone needs a place to live. Millions of consumers are looking for their next home online, and they expect the same kind of browsing and buying experience they get on sites like Amazon and Facebook. Unfortunately, real estate agents are struggling to provide that experience. That’s where Placester comes in. We’re creating an industry where it's quick and simple for real estate professionals to get their information on the web. Don’t let that simple description fool you. We’re addressing the hardest problem in the largest industry in the world. As you might have guessed, not everything is written on the home page yet.Our Culture: Team. Join the team that makes a difference in a big, complex industry. Our culture is all about teamwork. That being said, we're composed of folks who are their own brand of brilliant, focused, fun, intense, and friendly. If you've ever worked on a high performing team you've experienced this mix before. You’ll be expected to get things done and be responsible for making it happen, without any bureaucratical mess. You’ll be expected to identify problems and solve them on your own. But more importantly, you may need to rally a friend or team to overcome them. Both are key tools on your belt. You’ll be expected to have an opinion because it will matter when shaping the outcome of your company.Opinions are about courage: to speak your mind and to change it.

Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.This gives us the ability to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do.

      "SpaceX - Los Angeles, CA http://www.spacex.com/careersWe seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!\nNote for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",

      "DaisyBill - 34 W 15th Street, NYC - http://www.daisybill.comSenior Ruby/Rails/JS developer, full-time and local onlyDaisyBill does workers' compensation e-billing for the state of California.We're a small company with 5 people in NYC and 2 in California.Workers' Comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that performs services on the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.--We're looking for someone to help us with a new product/revenue stream we're going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We're also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.I'm Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.I'm looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2/PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I'd like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is also a plus. We use Git and I'd expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don't test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.I do interviews similarly to the way they're done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you're looking for in a position I'd have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they're interested in. I don't do conference room whiteboard programming.I don't have a degree, and I don't expect you to have one, either. I don't necessarily care about how long you've been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you're capable and can show it, I'm interested.You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.Cheers.",

      "San FranciscoIntransRuby Engineers, AndroidThe last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.\nWe are changing that.

We’ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.We’re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.We’re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.We’re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.We care about documentation: https://layer.com/docs/ios.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.We care about design.  We won’t be releasing our own apps - that’s up to our customers - but we’ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don’t have the keys we can’t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)Today we're a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We’re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.

The same flexibility that makes us future-proof for a given customer also makes us future-proof from a market perspective. So while a product company seeks a certain kind of product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us: our customers build it for themselves.Things we look for in a new team member:  • Learning agility \n  • Abstract reasoning \n  • Empathy\n  • Potential is more important than credential \n  • Confidence, but tempered by humility & the drive to get even better\n\nSome things we believe in:  • Mission = The Discovery of Truth.\n  • Radical transparency \n  • Design with a capital \"D\" \n  • Introspection \n  • Distributed innovation \n  • The importance of laughter \n  • Relationships are everything \n  • Play to your strengths; patch your weaknesses with diverse collaborators\n\nApply:  https://angel.co/keen-io/jobs",

For Android, be ready to explore the Android source code.Backend/frontend developers: \nA full stack developer, you can work on a feature from requirements and design to programming and testing.

H1B okay.AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We're a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure.No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.Visit http://amacapital.net/careers.html to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.",
